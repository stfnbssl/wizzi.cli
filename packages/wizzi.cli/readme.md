# wizzi-cli
The Wizzi command line interface (CLI) performs basic functionality, such as executing a Wizzi Production, creating a Wizzi Package based on a templated Meta Production, wizzifying an existent artifact or a folder of artifacts.

The Wizzi CLI (`wizzi-cli`) is packaged as an executable that can be used globally. The Wizzi CLI is available via [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) and should be installed globally by running

```sh
npm install -g wizzi-cli
```
Run `wz --help` for full help.
